\usage{
row_oneway_equalvar(x, g)

col_oneway_equalvar(x, g)

row_oneway_welch(x, g)

col_oneway_welch(x, g)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric matrix.}

\item{g}{a vector specifying group membership for each observation of x.}
}
\value{
a data.frame where each row contains the results of an oneway anova
test performed on the corresponding row/column of x.
The columns will vary depending on the type of test performed.\cr\cr
They will contain a subset of the following information:\cr
1. obs.tot - total number of observations\cr
2. obs.groups - number of groups\cr
3. sumsq.between - between group (treatment) sum of squares\cr
4. sumsq.within - within group (residual) sum of squares\cr
5. meansq.between - between group mean squares\cr
6. meansq.within - within group mean squares\cr
7. df.between - between group (treatment) degrees of freedom\cr
8. df.within - within group (residual) degrees of freedom\cr
9. statistic - F statistic\cr
10. pvalue - p.value
}
\description{
Performs an analysis of variance tests on each row/column of the input matrix.

\details{
Functions to perform ONEWAY ANOVA analysis for rows/columns of matrices.

\code{row_oneway_equalvar(x, g)} - oneway ANOVA on rows.
\code{col_oneway_equalvar(x, g)} - oneway ANOVA on columns.

Results should be the same as running \code{aov(x ~ g)}
on every row (or column) of \code{x}

\code{row_oneway_welch(x, g)} - oneway ANOVA with Welch correction on rows.
\code{col_oneway_welch(x, g)} - oneway ANOVA with Welch correction on columns.

Results should be the same as running \code{oneway.test(x, g, var.equal=FALSE)}
on every row (or column) of \code{x}
}
\examples{
col_oneway_welch(iris[,1:4], iris$Species)
